The weather was amazing and my friend and I took no chances with making certain the weather would be perfect.
We booked with Tonkin Cruise because the one day on Halong Bay was all around the best on all our shopping points: first the earliest start and arrival to board the ship of the 1 day cruises we considered. Local pick up at your hotel/hostel in old quarter of Hanoi made it easy to start our day at 7:00 am. We picked up a group of just under 20 people (2 being children under 10). This was accomplished in 40 minutes! By 8:00 am we were leaving Hanoi and made a rest stop for 10 minutes before arriving at Tonkin Harbor to board our ship by 10:40 am, ahead of schedule.

The ship is well maintained, clean and even luxurious for a one day cruise. Beautifully set tables for dining, a dozen lounge chairs to sun on and relax and enough seating all around the outdoor deck areas. There are shaded areas and the main deck entry conversation corners to also make and get to know new friends.

The toilets are all fully functioning, immaculately kept and all around the Tonkin is a lovely ship. Staff are friendly, Captain always has his doors open today hello and food is delicious and varied. Special dietary needs and allergies were also a concern if the staff in initial booking and again on day of cruise.
The route through the limestone hills and islands allowed for a good survey of the Bay and it’s most beautiful views.

We had ample down time between the many events planned: Kayaking, swimming or lounging in hammocks began our days’ events. Land transfer and a cave tour was a break from the ship, landing on Cat Ba Island. A spring roll making class followed as we also enjoyed fresh fruits and tea on our way back to Tonkin Harbor for sunset.

WiFi access is a available—so says the tour informational Booklet, but we were never told of this by our guide.

Our English speaking guide managed to keep us all on schedule and afforded us the promised FULL DAY on the water we wanted from 11am until sunset.

The cruise was US$70/person and booked the night before. All went according to plan promised us.

Beer and other soft drinks are available for a reasonable price onboard. Water was provided on bus to boat and lemon tea while on the boat.

Bus has AC and is clean and comfortable.

All-in-all, an excellent cruise, well managed and guide “Hung” is so pleasant and funny.
Great value for a full day!

You arrive back toHa our by 8:30pm

Had no expectations apart from riding a 150CC city bike when i booked and when i met Tam and spoke to him for a few mins on my way to the bike pick up point from my hotel i had made up my mind that im upgrading my bike.

Tam quickly upgraded my bike to a 400 CC at a very nominal cost and we we both were geared up to start the trip.

All i was expecting was a Tar mac road trip but our pal brought in various legs of off roading with his well aware detours from the main roads which made it completely enjoyable.

I would recommend this guys as the guide too as he is bit only knowledgeable about vietnam but can enlighten you about various global topics and make your breaks even more interesting.
Also he paid for all entries and meals and refreshments which was a total surprise and an amazing gesture from the most genuine guy i met.

L.A SaigonTours,-1,5.0,-1,-1,"My tourguide was a young student , he was very hillarious and excellent knowledges, she took me to go around the Saigon city, from D1 to D3 to see the local area which was located in the central area and it made myseft really suprised because i have never seen it before, we went around the flower market and cambodian street food to try the cuisine and enjoyed the local beer. after that we went back to D4 to see the Saigon river in the night time which was very gogerous and mysterious . I highly recommend this tour to every one
