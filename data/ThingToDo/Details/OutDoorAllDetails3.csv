The guide was friendly and spoke good English. Food on the boat was REALLY good! Rooms were good and clean with private bathrooms. Boat only had about 12 rooms so it is small and that is really nice. In the tour you see some cool caves and a pearl production place. You can also get kayaks and get the chance to swim off of a beach one day. Water is however very dirty and pretty crowded.

We decided to pay slightly more and go for Viet Beauty which we are happy to have done. If you want good food, clean rooms, a small and calm boat, Viet Beauty is great. Many other boats are huge and dirty, many are also over booked and have people sleeping on floors, really loud karaoke etc.",S·ªë 121 tr√™n 229 Chuy·∫øn tham quan b·∫±ng thuy·ªÅn & th·ªÉ thao d∆∞·ªõi n∆∞·ªõc ·ªü V·ªãnh H·∫° Long,https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/Attraction_Review-g293923-d7377271-Reviews-Viet_Beauty_Cruise_Private_Day_Tour-Halong_Bay_Quang_Ninh_Province.html

I like golfing in Thailand as most of the Clubs there provide for yellow tees for the benefit of seniors. Not so in Vietnam. On this trip, I opted to play from red tee and was happy to do so.
Both the BRG courses are well designed,with enough hazards to challenge both social and good golfers.
On the other hand, Montgomerie earned the distinction of worst value for money course.
The Group was unanimous that Hoian A Shores is the best of the courses on this trip. The greens and fairways were immaculaete.
The toilets and amenities are the best we have experienced on this trip. This link course is close to the sea and the winds were one of the challenges.
Understand this course is regarded as the best in Vietnam.

On the 1st of January he even accompanied us as our personal guide to go motorbiking. Our teenagers loved it and so did we. We did see some beautiful places and had a lovely lunch and diner together. He also gave us very much tips on how to visit Hoi An and took care of our transfer to Hu√©.

I can't say enough good things about their service, amazingly personal and responsive to my endless emails and WhatsApp messages.

Vien and the rest of the staff on the ferry were excellent, really friendly professional services. Super easy border crossing. Our party had the ferry to ourselves going down, so very comfortable. Bruce met us at the ferry terminal in Chau Doc and helped to get us set-up with SIM cards for Vietnam, then picked us up in the morning from hotel for a ride back to the dock.

The next morning we set-off for a 5 day charter on one of Mandarin's slow boats. Highly recommend if you're looking for a unique experience for a few days and have a sense of adventure. Very relaxing, just sipping drinks, playing cards and watching the world go by. There are endless small canals and waterways in the area to explore, and plenty of small towns along the way to stop along the way and get a room. Our captain was excellent, very accommodating to our requests. Basically worked like a self-hire boat with pilot, he took us anywhere on Google maps we wanted to go (but be prepared to do some of your own navigating).

These guys are pros and really put in the effort to provide a high standard of service.

The tour through the Mekong was truly fascinating and the homestay an experience we will never forget for lots of reasons
We enjoyed learning to cook with the hosts in their traditional kitchen and it was a good way to meet the other guests.
The accommodation was very basic but the experience of being in the Mekong region and being closer to the lovely people who live there was worth it. Take bug spray though and use it liberally!!
We asked the host if she could provide us with a bowl of pho rather than the set lunch. she was very accommodating and at lunchtime presented us with a steaming bowl of the most fragrant and delicious pho we have ever eaten

We had a list of sights we wanted to see as a minimum, and a budget on our mind, so I have sent a request for proposal email to about 6 tour operators in SEA region. Some of them tried to talk us out of the idea of visiting so many countries at once, some tried to sell their existing package not caring about our individual needs. And there was Indotrek who replied fastest, fitted the budget the most and tailored our trip to exactly match our wish. Now that we are heading to the airport after our almost 3 weeks visiting the above countries, I would like to express my eternal gratitude to Indotrek to have organised such a faboulous and unforgottable tour for us.

Already from the beginning our consultant (Ms Trang) was very responsive and helpful, always giving exact answers to all questions we had. She has dutifully made sure our agenda fitted all our flight times (flights booked by myself) and that we had the necessary visas for the travel. We even were asked to fill out a guest profile form which then was sent to all our guides to get know us even before we met. All this lead to a perfectly organised journey, during which everything happened perfectly as scheduled. We were greeted by their reps at each airport, from and to where we very safely driven in brand new, clean, huge cars supplied with unlimited amount of bottled cold (what a treasure!!) water, and refreshing towels. The same standard applied to all sightseeing tours and roadtrips.

We had local guides in each region, all of them were very helpful and knowledgeable, speaking at least a good level of English in the ever-so-typical local accent.

For the budget we had we were accomodated mostly in guesthouses and 3* hotels most of which were centrally located, and equipped with the basic amenities you would look for on such a trip (mini fridge, aircon, hot shower, wifi, etc). Breakfast and 1 bottle/person complimentary water however were included in all cases. Whenever lunch or dinner was included as part of the trip (mostly on the cruises) they were delicious local dishes.

Finally, the sights that were included in the journey were carefully selected, providing a really enjoyable agenda with sufficient free time too. Once in Saigon (the city where Indotrek is based) we were invited to meet their brand manager who came to see us in our hotel, invited us for a drink and we could give feedback on our tour. Very nice idea.

To sum it all up, I would like to recommend Indotrek when you visit Indochina and I would definitely choose them again. It would be difficult to enlist all the names one by one, so collectively we would like to say a big thank you to Indotrek office team, to all our guides, drivers and cruise crew (Sompoo in Laos and Aclass in Vietnam) to make this a memorable dream holiday for us!",S·ªë 163 tr√™n 424 Ho·∫°t ƒë·ªông ngo√†i tr·ªùi ·ªü Th√†nh ph·ªë H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh,https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/Attraction_Review-g293925-d11631362-Reviews-Indotrek-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html

I told them I was going to give them my passport the day after when I was taking back the motorbike after been repaired. He answered no passport no luggage and he took my luggage back to his office. I had to leave the restaurant in a hurry so I could get my luggage.
In the morning of the forth day I went there to ask if I could rent one extra day. But they told me you must leave the motorbike now because your 4 day rent they ended. It was 10.00 am. So I went to my hotel walking to get the contract and went back there. So they understood after showing the contract they were wrong because my day ended at 9.00pm. So I asked for one extra day and I paid him cash. The next morning at 9.00am he texted me saying bring me back the motorbike unless you pay more money.

The ship itself is quite nice but feels a bit tired.

1. The tour guide was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. unfortunately I don't remember her name, but is a 25 year old Vietnamese girl with the best energy ever, she made the experience even better.
2.The bus and driver were fine, no complaints
3. The temples, I honestly didn't like this part, however is not about the tour itself, more about the temples, not very impressive if you've seen temples in Asia already, they are small and quite similar, at some point I just went to wonder myself around the area.
4. The boat part obviously is the main attraction, it was great scenery, the local boat lady was fine, the trip feels long and refreshing, we even jumped into the water out of craziness. My only complaint is about the system itself, not the tour company. 70% of the time you are being asked for money, in one way or another, by taking photos of you, by giving tips, it's gets to the point of being very annoying. But the worst part is when you reach the end of the boat ride (or the point where you turn around) and they offer you to buy some snacks, they also offer you to buy for the boat person, as a tip, the annoying part is that they give without you even saying yes or no, OF COURSE, at any point you can just say no, but it's very annoying nonetheless, and the worst part, they don't even eat/drink the snacks, they storage them and return them back, so they can keep doing the same.
5. The bike ride was too short and the scenery was quite normal, I wasn't really expecting much from this so it didn't disappoint at the end. (be aware of the people taking photos again, so they can sell them to you later).

At the end the Ninh Binh scenary is beautiful and amazing, but the whole experience is annoying with SO MANY people doing stuff to get money out of you, I was in Sapa and Halong Bay during the same trip and didn't feel like I felt in Ninh Binh regarding this topic.

The tour company and the tour itself is recommended, it's only ruined by things out of their control. The tour guide did warned us about only buying what we liked, she was great.",S·ªë 16 tr√™n 28 Chuy·∫øn tham quan b·∫±ng thuy·ªÅn & th·ªÉ thao d∆∞·ªõi n∆∞·ªõc ·ªü Ninh BiÃÄnh,https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/Attraction_Review-g303945-d12001773-Reviews-Ninh_Binh_Daily_Tours-Ninh_Binh_Ninh_Binh_Province.html

We also visited a cafe to have an ""egg coffee"" this apparently is something they developed due to a shortage of milk in the Vietnam war. It tastes surprisingly very nice.
We were a bit apprehensive when we booked it due to the traffic in Hanoi and us only having a motorbike and sidecar to protect us. But we felt safe the whole time. Its an exhillerating way to see the sites either riding pillion or in the sidecar.
The whole way round Eric was taking photos which he later sends to you on Whatsapp.

We immediately appreciated his way of proposing discreetly some trips, without insisting and offering very convenient prices from the outset, sparing us bargaining, and setting up a trust atmosphere. Le trung arranged for us a 1-day boat trip in lan ha bay, with kayak, monkey island visit, floating fishermen‚Äôs village. We were afraid it could be long for our2 daughters of 2 and 9-years, but it was just perfect, well rhythmed and nice. Based on this great experience we also asked le trung to organise for us the liaison cat ba/tam coc. We took the bus of 12.30, the good surprise was that we took the speed boat (hydroglisseur)and the whole trip was very effective.

Bravo Indochina Tours,-1,3.5,-1,-1,"The below is a complaint we are lodging against Bravo Indochina. This will also be repeated via other social media platforms including Tripadvisor.

We made our booking with Bravo Indochina (via Tour Radar) two months ago and were initially impressed with their statement of, 'We hope our dedication and commitment can be the best assurance of the quality of service you can expect from Bravo Indochina Tours'. Unfortunately, our experience was far from this, and the problems started immediately.

Problems before departure:

1. Tour dates booked incorrectly with confirmation being sent to us showing the arrangements starting in November 2022 and finishing in September 2022!

2. We had an original print out of the itinerary, and it states Domestic flights were included. We paid in full and later were told that two of the flights were not included. Mysteriously the wording on the itinerary appeared to be dynamically changed and we were forced to pay more, which amounted to USD$229pp more. Bravo denied anything was changed, but our print-out proved otherwise

3. We requested to be picked up from a local hotel on day one in Phnom Penh instead of at the airport. We asked for 12 noon, but the itinerary was sent to us showing 12 midnight. Surely the person typing this would have realised this was an obvious error, but the errors and issues just kept on coming!

4. On the second day of the tour, the itinerary mentioned we were having a 'full day tour' of Phnom Penh starting at 0725, but the airport transfer was booked for 1300. Not sure how they thought this was a 'full day tour' instead of a 'half day' tour?

5. The itinerary stated the Angkor Wat tour started at 0900, but they were calling it a 'Sunset tour' without any suitable explanation given as to what we would be doing for the entire day until the actually sunset at 1730!

6. Another itinerary mistake that just showed no attention to detail for the excursion in Hoi An. It stated the My Son Sanctuary tour started at 2350 and finished at 0450!... Seriously, was anyone reading the itinerary!.. We ended up not doing this anyway.

7. Booking numbers for the flights were not shown on the itinerary, which concerned us. We were told to not worry about that and the airlines would have our details. In the end, we had every right to worry as will be explained further below.

8. We were told the Sunset tour river cruise in Phnom Penh would pick us up around 1500 and then the sunset would be at 1730. We thought the pick-up time was very early but accepted it.... As it turned out in reality, we were not picked-up until 1630.

Tour departure onward:

Day 1: The transfer from our local hotel to our first hotel on the tour (G Mekong) was provided with a non-English speaking driver in a Tuk-Tuk.... The image provided on the itinerary provided by Bravo Indochina showed a comfortable van and stated the driver would be English speaking. We appreciate we were not coming from the airport, but a taxi at least should have been provided. Instead, we had a Tuk Tuk with luggage on our laps roaring through the streets of Phnom Penh. The driver was supposed to arrive at 1200 noon, but instead turned up at 1100am whilst were having a late breakfast and therefore had to be turned away by hotel Management until 1200 noon.

Day 2: We were given the inclusions for the tour of Phnom Penh that was re-scheduled to 0700am, but the driver did not arrive until 0720am. After we rushed breakfast for the supposed 0700 pick-up time and based on the wording of the itinerary were expecting a decent view of the Royal Palace. In reality we were whisked past, and it was almost a blink, and you would miss it moment. We even had to mention to the guide about the visit and he seemed to be surprised that we were wanting to see it. The driver also thought the time stated on the itinerary for the flight departure to Siem Reap of 1300 was too late and was suggesting 1130 instead, but eventually sorted things out with Bravo Indochina with a compromised time.

Upon arrival in Siem Reap, we were offloaded at The Sanctuary Residence Siem Reap hotel. This was certainly not a sanctuary. The bed was so hard, that we had to end up asking to change rooms for the second night and signs inside the lobby mentioning not bringing firearms into the property was a little disconcerting.

Day 3: The bad experience at the hotel continued with an abysmal breakfast. There were three staff standing at the entrance to the restaurant to welcome us, but none of them seemed to want to do any work to replenish the so called 'buffet' with empty juice containers and scraps left in the Bain-maries. The restaurant opening times stated that breakfast was still had an hour to go, but there was virtually nothing left, and I was forced to speak to Management to get the staff to re-fill the breakfast items. The whole situation was so bad that we decided to eat out independently the following morning at a Cafe.

We then flew to Ho Chi Minh city. Upon exiting the Arrivals Hall our driver was nowhere to be seen. We eventually found our driver, but he did not have our names on his sign and for some reason had an 'Intrepid' holidays logo instead of 'Bravo Indochina'.. We ended up being dumped at the 'Blue Diamond Luxury Hotel. This property may look okay in the pictures, but it is certainly not suitable for Western travellers. The decor and restaurant offerings seem more geared to the local Asian market. The only good thing about this hotel was the location.

Day 4: Today was a tour to the Cu Chi Tunnels with lunch. I don't think the guide was reading the itinerary as tour spots were either missed or jumbled around. It is appreciated that you need to be flexible on vacation, but no explanation was given for the changes and it always kept us guessing if points would be missed and as it turned out we did miss the local market and documentary film. Lunch was beyond terrible. We barely ate anything. The Waitress seemed a bit upset, but what do you expect when options are not supplied, and you are just expected to eat foreign food without any explanation in English provided to advise what you are eating. No thought was given for clients coming from a Western country.

Our Vietnam airlines flight from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang got changed to a later time, which was totally unnecessary and meant we did not get to Hoi An until 2200. Our guide to the Cu Chi tunnels was aware of the change, but Bravo Indochina failed to tell us at the same time. Bravo advised the change was done by the airline, but Vietnam airlines provided us a screenshot of the air booking and it showed the booking was ticketed on 12 Nov for the later flight. If Bravo had actually booked us on the flight shown on the itinerary, it wouldn't have been necessary for the guide to take us to the sheltered workshop with staff making lacquer art in a factory. We had no interest in this at all and I'm sure the guide did not like us not making any purchases and thus missing out on a potential kick-back.

Arriving in Hoi An much later in the day than expected, we were eventually given the room category (river view) that was shown in the itinerary picture and that Bravo Indochina confirmed they would request. This was the view we were really looking forward to, but the hotel initially tried to give us a room at the back of the property, which was not appealing at all. The issue with the room was the last thing we needed after a long day and the hotel made us feel like we were trying to get something for free.

We asked Bravo Indochina what compensation could be provided for these continual issues as they were certainly not volunteering anything before this, and they advised they could provide a dinner for us. We never ended up getting this meal as the company could not find a suitable Western restaurant for us. They only seemed to want to keep constantly steering us towards a Pan-Asian style eatery in Hanoi that they had contracted. We ended up with nil compensation as it all seemed too difficult for them.

Day 5: Another itinerary mistake with the journey from Hoi An to Hue. It stated at 0700 departure, but at the same time, it mentioned 'enjoying a morning at leisure'.... Why was this not being picked up by staff at Bravo Indochina?... An obvious mistake and we had to fight to get our morning at leisure until 1100am.

Upon arrival in Hue, it was obvious there was really only one thing to see in the city for tourists and that is the Citadel. We really could have missed this and would rather have stayed longer in Hoi An or at the next spot in Hanoi. The two-three hour journey to get there was not worth it and Bravo conceded that Hanoi was much more interesting than Hue.

Day 6: The Vietnam airlines flight shown on the itinerary was changed to budget carrier Vietjet. We therefore were expected to get up earlier again unnecessarily because of this change. It was explained the original flight shown on the itinerary was not suitable, but why was it shown if it wasn't?.. Again, lack of attention to detail or an error?... We spoke to Customer Service at Vietnam airlines and they confirmed we were never booked on the flight shown on the itinerary. We should be compensated for this change to a lower class of carrier than what was paid for, which we worked out was half the price of Vietnam airlines. All of this confirmed to us the real reason the flight booking numbers not being supplied was because in our opinion the flights were not booked when the itinerary documents were emailed.

After arriving in Hanoi, we were met by the guide for the city tour in a sedan. He seemed to think we would be driving around for the duration of the tour and knew nothing about the rickshaw component mentioned in the itinerary. He did call his office and got it organised, but it was concerning that he did not know about the rickshaw ride, which ended up being the best part of the tour and we would have been very disappointed if we had of missed out.

The hotel in Hanoi was the Hanoi Nostalgia Hotel & Spa. We were given a room overlooking an inner courtyard but had expected a room at the front of the property. The room attendant told us the rooms at the front were VERY noisy and therefore we stayed with the room provided. When we came back for our second visit after the Halong Bay excursion we were then put into a room at the front, and it turned out the rooms have double doors facing the street and therefore noise was not an issue at all. Unfortunately, the hotel was caught out with this lie.

Day 7: We were really looking forward to the Halong Bay Cruise. Yet again the itinerary was incorrect and stated we would be travelling with a company called Indochina Junk. We had researched that cruise company and were happy with what was going to be offered. As it turned out, we were put onto a company called Cozy Bay Cruises. What a dump of a vessel!!.. It started with an uncomfortable bus taking us to the pier and once we got on the boat, we had a cabin with a bathroom that flooded from a mysterious water source, a shower door that did not seal properly and a bathroom curtain that we could not open and close. Most of the food and fortunately our fellow travellers were the only saving grace.

The guide for the Halong Bay excursion advised us before travelling back to Hanoi that our hotel in Hanoi had been changed. This was supposedly done to upgrade us to a nicer property. We are not sure what the true reason for the change was and were even questioning if our original hotel had been booked, but we actually liked our original hotel in old Hanoi and had booked to go to see the Water Puppets near the hotel.

We were two men travelling on this holiday, but the hotels and drivers seemed to be often confused and were expecting a man and a woman. Even one of our air tickets said Ms instead of Mr, that really could have caused a problem at the airport, but fortunately did not. Again, attention to detail by Bravo Indochina was lacking. WhatsApp messages would come through saying Hi Sell, instead of Hi Mr Sells.

It seemed almost impossible to get straight answers from Bravo Indochina as our difficult questions were either not answered or very minimally answered. This all proved very frustrating and ruined the vacation. We know Bravo Indochina have the right to change the itinerary, but it seemed to be a convenient excuse to cover up mistakes and it always worked to our detriment.

Final documents were also very slow in coming and had to be chased up though Tour Radar.

All in all, this vacation was a total disaster from start to finish and we would like to see an adequate response from Bravo Indochina and Tour Radar with suitable compensation.",S·ªë 90 tr√™n 224 L·ªõp h·ªçc & h·ªôi th·∫£o ·ªü H√† N·ªôi,https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/Attraction_Review-g293924-d7057241-Reviews-Bravo_Indochina_Tours-Hanoi.html

Chuong Nguyen,-1,5.0,-1,-1,"What a great way to see a great place!

I thoroughly enjoyed the 25 or so km walk through this still low-key rural area. It was spread over most of 2 days and a very relaxed, informative ramble with our guide, Mr. Chuong Nguyen. He seemed well informed generally and very well known to locals who often stopped to chat. He spoke English quite well enough to keep us in the know.

Some of the folks I was with were not prepared for the walking so Chuong arranged for our driver to pick them up along the way.

Pu Luong has a local and traditional feel to it. It's super lush, small villagers and farmers were doing what they'd been doing for generations. And as was my experience in Vietnam almost universally, they were oh so friendly and kind.

I loved seeing how simple irrigation techniques keep the rice growing. A woman graciously stopped spinning cotton to show us how local Hill People wore the beautiful weaving she produced. The inter-village soccer match we happened upon was also great fun!

We had a great stay at our homestay in Pu Luong which featured individual huts for guests. The food and hospitality was great!

Our tour had been seen to by our hosts at the Trang An Precious Homestay. It was well organized the the guide and driver were great choices!

And I'm not saying that just because the three of us went out for a beer afterwards! üòÜ

As you get on the launch they serve you fruits and a bottle of water. However on my boat they didn‚Äôt have any guide talking about the bridges and there wasn‚Äôt the advertised cultural dance on the boat.

HAPPY PLUS TRAVEL,-1,5.0,-1,-1,"I had a wonderful time visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels and the Mekong Delta with the help of David, who was an excellent planner and organizer. He understood my requirements well and was always available for any kind of query resolution. He arranged the best tour guide one can ask for, Mr Bui, who had deep knowledge on our tours and Saigon culture and always kept the group intact with beautiful stories and history.

I was scared of being asked for tips at random places as I had read about it (especially in Mekong Delta). When I let David know the same, he made sure that we were comfortable everywhere by letting the tour guide know in advance who would then always come up if he saw someone persuading for tips. So we had nothing to worry about on this perspective and this reassurance of not worrying about anything made our trip really mesmerizing.

Our requests for vegetarian food and small group (< 10 pax) were also considered, so the tour guide could focus on us and it was not crowded. Our limousine bus was extremely comfortable, very silent so we got a good amount of time to relax in between and yes not to forget cold water bottle was provided 500 ml each and pickup & drop was exactly from the hotel point. Excellent Hospitality & the pickup and drop services were well informed in advance.

Unlike many tours that are about money, here the focus is solely on hospitality and rich experience. We were given options to pay for the trip whenever we felt the most comfortable with - be it cash or online payment (with no platform charges for international travellers, so we paid exactly what was asked). Along with the bigger things, all the other little things, like proper wait time for restrooms and time for breakfast, were adequately provided for each one of us.

David made our day in HCMC really brighter and I would 101% recommend him to anyone for any kind of trip planning. He is the best planner you can find in HCMC!",S·ªë 66 tr√™n 273 Ph∆∞∆°ng ti√™Ã£n giao th√¥ng ·ªü Th√†nh ph·ªë H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh,https://www.tripadvisor.com.vn/Attraction_Review-g293925-d19604677-Reviews-HAPPY_PLUS_TRAVEL-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html
